- open the 'Matlab Files' folder and download all the files, then upload them to your Matlab.
- open the 'main_forward_kinematics.m' file and run it for computing the Forward Kinematic model, and 'main_inverse_kinematics.m' for Inverse Kinematics model.
- You can use this code for any robot; you just need to draw your robot kinematics scheme and change the parameters in main files according to your robo scheme.

ps. sigma parameter is (=0) for revolute joint and (=1) for prismatic joint.
