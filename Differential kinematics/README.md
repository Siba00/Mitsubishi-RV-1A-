# Differential kinematics
This repository is part of Dynamics of Non Linear Robotic Systems [DNLRS] course for first year master students at Innopolis University.
_____________________________________________________________________________
1. open the 'Matlab Files' folder and download all the files, then upload them to your Matlab.
2. open the 'cmd.txt' file and copy all the lines and paste them in the command window of Matlab.
_____________________________________________________________________________
the 'cmd.txt' file contains:
1. Deriving the Jacobian in both Geometrical and Numerical methods (symbolically).
2. Implement this for Mitsubishi RV-1A model.
3. Using the Jacobian matrix to check for singularities.
_____________________________________________________________________________
ps. you can choose any initial condition and test its singularity by changing the values of q.
